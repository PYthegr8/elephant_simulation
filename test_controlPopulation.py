# This module tests the controlPopulation function in elephant_simulation.py

#
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
# Test 1
# Out of 5144 adult female elephants, 2587 are darted, leading to a percentage of 0.503. It should be 0.500
#
# Test 2
# 100 should have been culled and 100 were
# 
# Test 3
# Out of 5036 adult female elephants, 5036 are darted, leading to a percentage of 1.000. It should be 1.000
# 
# Test 4
# We needed to cull 1000 elephants and 1000 elephants were culled
# Out of 1000 calves before culling, approximately 909 should remain after culling. 913 remain.
# 
# Test 5
# We needed to cull 0 elephants and 0 elephants were culled
# Out of 0 calves before culling, approximately 0 should remain after culling. 0 remain.
# 
# Test 6
# We needed to cull 10000 elephants and 10000 elephants were culled
# Out of 10000 calves before culling, approximately 5000 should remain after culling. 5015 remain.
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
